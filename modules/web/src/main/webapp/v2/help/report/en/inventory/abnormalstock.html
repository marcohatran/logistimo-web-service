                Abnormal stock report provides insights into stock abnormality based on abnormal stock events including
                zero stock, < min and > max events. It offers views by number of events in a given period as well as the
                duration of the events, with charts viewable over time, and tabular listings available by other
                dimensions such as materials, entities and locations.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can select one or more of the filters of material, entity or location and click on 'Get report' to
                get the report. Within the report view, you can select any abnormality type such as zero stock, < min
                and > max and one of the metrics below to view the report.
            </p>

            <p>
                The metrics in this report as described below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Number of events:</b> This metric represents the number of stock abnormality events (either zero
                    stock, < min or > max, as selected) in the given period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Average number of events per entity:</b> This metric represents the average number of stock
                    abnormality events (either zero stock, < min or > max, as selected) in the given period. This is
                    computed by dividing the total number of events by the number of entities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Duration of event (days):</b> This metric represents the total duration of events (either zero
                    stock, < min or > max, as selected) in the given period. In a given period (e.g. a month), the
                    portion of time that a given event was open is attributed to that period. It could be either part of
                    the time or the entire time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Average duration per event (days):</b> This metric represents the average duration per
                    abnormality event (be it zero stock, < min or > max). This is computed by dividing the total
                    duration of events in a given period by the number of events in the same period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>% of inventory items with this abnormality:</b> This metric represents the percentage of
                    inventory items of a particular abnormality type (either zero stock, < min or > max) for X% of the
                    period, where X = 100%, >= 90%, >= 80%, >= 70%. For instance, this provides a view of the percentage
                    of inventory items that were, say, stocked out, for more than, say, 90% of time within a given
                    period. This metric is computed by dividing the number of inventory items with a particular stock
                    abnormality (such as zero stock, < min or > max) by the total number of inventory items in that
                    domain.
