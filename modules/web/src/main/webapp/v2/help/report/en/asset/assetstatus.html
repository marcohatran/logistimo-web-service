        <p>
            Asset status report provides an overview of the number of times and duration that assets change states,
            such as working, under repair, beyond repair, and so on. Using this report, one can understand, for
            instance, the number of times assets went 'under repair' (or broke down) or started working in a given
            period. It also indicates the average duration in which an asset stayed in a particular state, say, the
            average working duration of assets in a given domain or entity or other filter criteria.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metrics in this report as described below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Number of times assets changed to this state:</b> This metric is
                computed by counting number of asset state changes to the selected status in the given period, across
                all assets within the filter criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Average number of times assets changed to this state:</b> This metric
                is computed by dividing the number of asset state changes (to this state) by the total number of assets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Average duration in this state per asset (in days):</b> This metric is computed by dividing the
                total duration (in days) of a given status (e.g. working, under
                repair) across all assets by the total number of assets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>% of assets in this state:</b> This metric represents the
                proportion of assets in a given state at the end of the period. It is computed by dividing the sum of
                all assets in a given state at the end of the period by the total number of assets.
            </li>
